            <p>I'm graduating from Coventry University Computer Science in May 2018 and am looking for a job to go into shortly after that. </p>
            <p>My field is software engineering. I specialise in working on lower-level technical problems in languages like C++, Java, D and Python. 
            I'm a huge lover of Free and Open Source Software. Linux is my primary platform with 98% of my favored tools and technologies being FOSS. 
            Of course, Windows and other platforms are never a problem. Just different. </p>
            <p>I'd be looking for a permanant position. I'd really like to be working onsite in or around Nottingham, UK, but will certainly consider offers
            of remote work, commuting, part-time commuting (such as a job in London). I speak rudimentory German, having been learning for 3 years. </p>
            <p> Please have a mooch around my information below, and do get in touch if you'd like to talk further about what I'm looking for, or to tell me about
            any positions you have, or if you know of anyone with any positions I might want to look into!
