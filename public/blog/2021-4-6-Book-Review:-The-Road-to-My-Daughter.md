# Book Review: The Road to My Daughter

The author of this true account is a friend of my mother's, together they've shared experiences
of having a trans daughter. My mum wanted me to read this so I could
pass comment on how Milly's ( the daughter in the book ) transition and experiences is similar,
or dissimilar to my own.
I won't be doing much of that here (although I'm happy to talk about it if asked).

I was worried that [The Road to My Daughter - Elisabeth Spencer](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/products/isbn/9781785906497/30881133361) would be an account
of a mother's struggle with her daughter's transition, but I was pleasantly
surprised when the book turned out to be a trans women's struggle from the point of view of her mother.
Of course, the author does discuss how Milly's transition has been hard for
her, but the focus is always on her daughter's struggle to be happy with herself.

The book is painful to read as a trans person. It forces the
reader to think about their own experiences with trans healthcare, unsupportive family and
moving through life as one transitions.
I cried a lot at the pain the author has suffered too, particularly the loss
of her husband, Baz, following traumatic years of sharing palliative care 
between Milly and herself. I also felt for the author as she delt with
family unsupportive of her trans daughter and seeing her daughter struggle.

While much of the author's words are about how she personally feels as Milly
goes through various stages to reach her transition goals, there is a
lot of cited research included.
We read about the side effects of HRT medication and statistics on how many
people go down what surgical routes.
There are upsetting statistics about the suicide rates among trans people
forced to wait for years to move forward in a system with too many patients to
care for.

I'm pleased that this book spends so much time using facts from research to help the reader
appreciate just how difficult, traumatising and demoralising it is to be
transgender ( particularly in the UK ).
While none of this information is new to me personally, it is important that
people not _in the know_ understand the numbers.

The author is not afraid to question her own actions. She frequently writes
about how the things she says to her daughter ( often early on in the process )
were wrong, She has clearly put a lot of effort into understanding why certain
phases, words and sentiments are unwelcome to trans ears despite seeming
totally innocent. 
Learning and questioning your own past actions is a very important factor in
being an excellent ally.

While the transition pathway that Milly follows in the book is not entirely
dissimilar to many trans women's story, it is out of the realms of possibility
for the vast majority of, especially younger, trans women.
Milly accesses almost all of her trans healthcare and surgeries privately ( i.e
she pays for them out of pocket).
She is lucky to find an NHS GP willing to engage in trans care with
private providers, as well as finding a private endocrinologist willing
to prescribe HRT after only one appointment.
After only 5 years, she is on a regular HRT regime, had hair removal, extensive voice
coaching and multiple surgeries in foreign countries.
None of this is impossible, with good research and a large amount of
sustainable funds, but should not be taken as the normal experience in the UK for
most people. The majority of trans people in the UK wait 3+ years to be _seen_
at an NHS gender clinic and even then getting to Milly's point can take a decade.

When I say this book was 'not for me', I don't mean I think it was bad.
I mean that this book was not written for trans people to read, this book is
for parents and family members of trans people.
It'd make a good introduction for those cis people wishing to understand what it means to
be trans as an approachable read written by someone who is more like them.
If you're a trans person with skeptical or dismissive family and friends, its
worth asking them to read this, hopefully they can identify with the author.

However, it is important to know that this book is written by a cis woman, and
does not contribute to the amplifying of *trans* voices telling their *own*
stories and struggles. Always prefer books about being trans written by trans folk.

The book is well researched, well written and excellently presented.
Aside from using the word 'Transgenderism' multiple times, ew, weird, stop that please Mrs Spencer.
