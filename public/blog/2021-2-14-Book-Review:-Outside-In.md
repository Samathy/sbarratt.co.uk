# Book Review: Outside In

A few weeks ago I read and reviewed "Inside Out" the first in this series by Mary V Snyder.
At the end of that review, I said I'd be reading "Outside In" purely out of curiosity for what the author could
possibly do with a second novel.

I have to say, Outside In is a marked improvement over the first entry in the series.

The second book takes place after the committee is instated to run The
Inside.

Our main character, Trella, is part of this
committee initially. The book follows Trella and
her friends as The Inside is invaded by an other
people.

Compared to Inside Out, the sequel's storyline is very good.
Its entertaining, full of twists and unexpected events.
There is still a lot of glossing over of world lore and very little
description of The Inside's technology. However, a lot of the lore and
world-building information that was missing from Inside Out and the
early half of Outside In is explored in the latter half of Outside In.

The character development in book 2 is much better than the first book.
We're still stuck with exactly the supporting cast that
Trella needs to be the hero of the story, but at
least most of them put her under some kind of
stress or pressure with their actions, rather than
just being the perfect side-kicks all through as
before.

There is a lot of surprise betrayal, secret support and surprising
changes of heart in the supporting cast.
The unlikely alliances which develop in the latter half of the book 
keep it interesting.

The writing of Outside In in terms of pacing and flow is miles better
than Inside Out. Although I still felt like important, big-finish scenes
often felt rushed, just like Inside Out.

I felt much more engaged with Trella's struggle as she is left,
essentially alone, to figure out who are the good guys, who are the bad guys and 
how to get everyone out of this situation alive and well.
